# 👋 Hi, I'm Sina Ma — Welcome to My GitHub

I'm a self-taught programmer and computer science graduate with a passion for **frontend development**, **cybersecurity**, and **Python scripting**. I love building clean and responsive web interfaces using **TailwindCSS**, solving security challenges, and exploring creative automation.

Over the past few years, I’ve launched educational platforms, worked as a freelance developer, participated in CTFs, and studied trading psychology — all while constantly learning and growing my technical skills.
