# 👋 Hi, I'm Sina Maghsoudi | Welcome to My GitHub

I'm a self-taught programmer and **computer engineering graduate** with a deep passion for **cybersecurity** and **ethical hacking** . whether it’s attacking as a Red Teamer or defending as part of the Blue Team. I love exploring system vulnerabilities, simulating real-world attacks, and developing secure solutions that strengthen digital defenses.

Beyond cybersecurity, I also enjoy **frontend development**, **Python scripting**, and studying **financial markets**. I take pride in building clean, responsive web interfaces with TailwindCSS, automating repetitive tasks, and **constantly learning** new ways to merge creativity with security.

Over the past few years, I’ve launched educational platforms, worked as a freelance developer, participated in CTFs, and studied trading psychology all while constantly learning and growing my technical skills.
