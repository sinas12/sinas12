# 👋 Hi, I'm Sina Maghsoudi — Welcome to My GitHub

I'm a self-taught programmer and computer engineering graduate with a passion for **frontend development**, **cybersecurity**, **Python scripting** , and **Financial markets** .

Over the past few years, I’ve launched educational platforms, worked as a freelance developer, participated in CTFs, and studied trading psychology — all while constantly learning and growing my technical skills.
